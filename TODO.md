This ws is for comparision of AMCL to Motion Capture.
For this, there are several steps to be done:
- For steering:
    - Use Virtual Leader with Lissajous Trajectory
    - use mocap
- Measurements of localization:
    - Use AMCL
    - Use Mocap
- Compare both by using Time Series Objects
    - show [trend](https://builtin.com/data-science/time-series-python?)?

### Compare amcl to mocap
